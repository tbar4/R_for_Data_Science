# Chapter 2 - Workflow: Basics

## Coding Basics
```{r, error=TRUE}
## R can be used as a calculator 

1/200*30

(59 + 73 + 2) / 3 

sin(pi / 2)

## You can create new objects with <-

x <- 3 * 4

print(x)

## Be careful of typos

r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3

## r_rock, as an example, will result in an error

r_rock
```

## Calling Functions

```{r}
## Run a sequence function 1-10, notice how the parentheses autofills and lists details to that function

seq(1,10)

## Quotations auto double, also. If you don't close the parantheses R will continue the script

x <- "Hello World"

## Once you create a variable, you can type the variable in order to view the result

y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)
y

## Or, you can start the variable with an open parentheses to immediately show the result

(y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5))
```
